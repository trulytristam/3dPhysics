When you put code in your Glium event loop, it will cause the window to become laggy and slow because the loop blocks the main thread and takes up all of the available resources. 
This means that other tasks, such as drawing to the window, can't be processed until the loop is finished. 
To avoid this, you should try to offload as much of the work as possible to a separate thread so that the main thread can remain free to perform other tasks.
